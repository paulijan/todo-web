- A list to display tasks with options to edit or delete each task.

**Script**

The script manages the application logic using Vue's Composition API:
- **Refs:** `newTodo`, `editTodo`, `editIndex`, `filter`, `sortOption`, and `todos` are reactive references.
- **Computed Properties:** `filteredAndSortedTodos` to filter and sort tasks.
- **Lifecycle Hook:** `onMounted` to load tasks from the backend when the component is mounted.
- **Methods:** `addTodo`, `removeTodo`, `loadTodos`, `editTask`, `updateTodo`, `updateTodoStatus`, and `cancelEdit` for various functionalities.
### Styles

The styles define the appearance of completed tasks.
